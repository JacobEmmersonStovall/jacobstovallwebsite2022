I recently got a cold email from a recruiter about a job at a startup company. I've been receiving these emails a lot recently so I sent a response and asked them how they got my email. Shortly after, I found out that certain recruiter bots scraped emails from websites. Horridly, I reflected that my current website just listed my name and my old job title. Therefore, I decided to change up my website a little bit.

I heard about a new full-stack framework called Fresh which piqued my interest. Given that it used technologies I was familiar with (Typescript / Preact), I decided to spend a few hours drafting up a new website. My plan was to make the code public and to use the deno hosting option to deploy it. If you're seeing this now, you are either reading the source code or you are on the website and it ended up working out.

I want to build out the site a little bit more with the following:

- links to projects I have worked on (where available - most of my work is corporate so that can be hard)
- more posts about my work as time goes on to give some insights about myself
- new hobby projects for fun once I settle down and get a lot of my extra work off of my plate

Overtime, we will see how plausible all of this is, but for now, at least my website is a little larger and gives a better context of my background.
